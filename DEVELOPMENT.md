- ✅ CSV parsing with PapaParse
- ✅ Data validation and error handling
- ✅ API client and service layer

### Phase 3: Global State Management
- ✅ Zustand stores for earthquake data
- ✅ UI state management
- ✅ Async data fetching patterns
- ✅ Loading and error state handling

### Phase 4: UI Foundation & Context
- ✅ React Context for selection state
- ✅ Custom hooks for data management  
- ✅ Reusable UI components
- ✅ Error boundaries and fallbacks

### Phase 5: Interactive Chart Implementation
- ✅ Recharts scatter plot visualization
- ✅ Configurable axis selectors
- ✅ Magnitude-based styling
- ✅ Interactive tooltips and selection

### Phase 6: Advanced Table Implementation
- ✅ Virtualized table for performance
- ✅ Sorting and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Enhanced pagination controls
- ✅ Search and data filtering

### Phase 7: Final Integration & Polish
- ✅ Two-panel responsive layout
- ✅ Bidirectional interactions
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Professional UI/UX polish

## Git Commit Strategy

Each phase represents a logical milestone in development:

1. **Incremental Development**: Each commit adds meaningful functionality
2. **Feature Isolation**: Related changes grouped together
3. **Clear Progression**: Easy to follow development timeline
4. **Rollback Safety**: Each phase is stable and functional

## State Management Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Props Pattern
- Parent-to-child data flow
- Event handlers passed as props
- Component composition

### 2. React Context
- Selection state management
- Theme provider pattern
- Global state without prop drilling

### 3. Zustand Store
- Global earthquake data management
- Async actions and side effects
- Performant state updates

## Technical Decisions

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtualized table rendering for large datasets
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient data transformation pipelines

### User Experience
- Loading indicators and error boundaries
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design patterns
- Accessibility considerations

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code consistency
- Modular architecture
- Comprehensive error handling

## Lessons Learned

1. **Structured Development**: Phase-based approach improved code organization
2. **State Management**: Multiple patterns provide flexibility for different use cases
3. **Performance**: Virtualization essential for large dataset handling
4. **User Experience**: Loading states and error handling crucial for production apps
5. **Git History**: Clean commits make project evolution easy to follow
